    <h1>Welcome to my Travel Blog!</h1>


<!--Header font sizes are consistent throughout the pages.
    The first header is the largest (h1) and the remaining headers on the page are slightly smaller (h2).-->
    
<!-- I created a class called "tabs" so I could align these tabs to the center of the page in CSS.-->

    <div class="tabs">
        <a class="tabs" href="index.html">Welcome</a>
        <a class="tabs" href="index1.html">Travels</a>
        <a class="tabs" href="index2.html">Contact</a>
    </div>

<!--Here I used an anchor element along with its href to create a hyperlink so that users
can find the exact page I've created on this website.-->

    <div id="about-me">
    <h2>All About Me:</h2>

<!--Since these are my personal photos, I uploaded them into my folder and now
the images can be found by using a relevant path.-->

<!--I also adjusted the width sizes in an attempt to have all the images lined up evenly
on the page.-->
